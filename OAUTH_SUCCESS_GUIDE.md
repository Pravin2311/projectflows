## Test the OAuth Flow

### 1. Navigate to Your Project
1. Go to your project page in the app
2. Look for the "Enable Email Invites" button

### 2. Test OAuth Authentication  
1. Click "Enable Email Invites"
2. Complete the Google OAuth consent flow
3. Grant permissions for the requested scopes
4. You should be redirected back to your app

### 3. Success Indicators
After successful OAuth completion, you should see:

- Email invite functionality becomes active
- Ability to send real Gmail invitations to team members

## URGENT: Add Yourself as Test User

Your OAuth app is in "Testing" mode, which means you need to add yourself as a test user to access it.

### Steps to Add Test User:
1. **Go to Google Cloud Console** → APIs & Services → **OAuth consent screen**
2. **Scroll down to "Test users" section**
3. **Click "ADD USERS"**
4. **Add your email**: `mydomain2311@gmail.com` (from your screenshot)
5. **Click "Save"**
6. **Go back to your project and try OAuth again**

### After Adding Test User:
1. Click "Enable Email Invites" in your project
2. Complete OAuth flow - should work now without "Access blocked" error

This is the final step to make OAuth work!

## Next Steps After Success
