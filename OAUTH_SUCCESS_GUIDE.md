# OAuth Setup Complete - Ready for Testing

## Current Status: ✅ Ready to Test

Your Google OAuth setup is now properly configured:

✅ **OAuth Credentials**: Client ID and Secret configured  
✅ **Redirect URIs**: Added Replit domain callback URL  
✅ **OAuth Consent Screen**: Configured with "External" and "Testing" status  
✅ **Required Scopes**: All Google API scopes added (Drive, Gmail, userinfo)  
✅ **User Type**: External - perfect for development testing  

## Test the OAuth Flow

### 1. Navigate to Your Project
1. Go to your project page in the app
2. Look for the "Enable Email Invites" button

### 2. Test OAuth Authentication  
1. Click "Enable Email Invites"
2. Complete the Google OAuth consent flow
3. Grant permissions for the requested scopes
4. You should be redirected back to your app

### 3. Success Indicators
After successful OAuth completion, you should see:
- "Gmail Enabled" toast notification
- Email invite functionality becomes active
- Ability to send real Gmail invitations to team members

## If You Encounter Issues

### Common Solutions:
- **Still getting access_denied**: Make sure you added yourself as a test user
- **Scope errors**: Verify all 5 scopes are added in consent screen
- **Redirect errors**: Ensure both HTTP and HTTPS callback URLs are added

### Test User Setup:
If OAuth still fails, ensure you're added as a test user:
1. Go to OAuth consent screen → Test users
2. Add your email address 
3. Save changes
4. Try OAuth flow again

## Next Steps After Success
Once OAuth works:
1. Test sending email invitations to team members
2. Verify Gmail integration is functioning properly
3. Ready for production deployment with proper domain configuration

Your platform-managed OAuth implementation is complete and ready for testing!
