## For Platform Owners: One-Time Google Cloud Setup

If you're deploying this platform for others, you need to configure Google OAuth once:

### Steps:
1. **Create Google Cloud Project**
2. **Enable APIs**: Gmail API, Google Drive API  
3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - Application type: Web application
   - Authorized redirect URIs: Add your domain + `/platform-oauth-callback`
   - Example: `https://your-platform.com/platform-oauth-callback`
4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```
   PLATFORM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.googleusercontent.com
   PLATFORM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

### Domain Updates:
When deploying to new domains, just add the new callback URL:
- `https://new-domain.com/platform-oauth-callback`

That's it! All your users can now use the platform without any Google Cloud Console setup.
